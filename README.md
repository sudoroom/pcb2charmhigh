     -o,
    --output  CSV file for the PnP

     -f,

## Layout
Board Origin must to below and to the left of your circuit.
The Charmhigh cannot use negative numbers from the Origin.
Place a Fiducial footprint to mark the location on the F-Cu layer.
Use this mark to visually align the origin.

## Feed file
The feed file is generated by the Pick and Place. Go through the normal
setup process on the machine, saving the file to the SD card. Fetch the
project file from the card. This will maintain the rest of the file as is
while updating the section pertaining to placements.
